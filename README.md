## Dynamic Lambda Loader Server

This is a simple server program that simulates an AWS Lambda-like functionality. It loads dynamic libraries at runtime and executes functions within those libraries based on client requests.

## Usage

To compile the server, run the following command:

```
gcc -o server server.c -ldl
```

To start the server, run the compiled binary:

```
./server
```

The server will listen for incoming client connections and execute the specified functions from the loaded dynamic libraries.

## Client-Server Communication

The server listens on a Unix domain socket and expects client connections. Clients can send commands to the server to execute specific functions from dynamic libraries.

The communication between the client and server follows the following :

1. The client connects to the server using the Unix domain socket.
2. The client sends a command in the format: `<library_name> [<function_name> [<filename>]]`.
   - `<library_name>`: The name of the dynamic library to load and execute functions from.
   - `<function_name>`: The name of the function to execute within the library (optional).
   - `<filename>`: The filename to pass as an argument to the function (optional).
3. The server executes the specified function within the loaded library (if applicable).
4. The server captures the output generated by the function and sends it back to the client the name of the file where the result will be stored.
5. The client receives the output file and can process it as needed.

## Dynamic Library Loading and Execution

The server dynamically loads libraries using the `dlopen` function from `dlfcn.h`. It searches for the specified library and retrieves function pointers based on the provided function name.

The loaded libraries are expected to contain functions with the following signatures:

1. Functions without parameters:
   ```
   typedef void (*lambda_func_t)(void);
   void run();
   ```

2. Functions with a single parameter (filename):
   ```
   typedef void (*lambda_param_func_t)(const char *);
   void p_run(const char *filename);
   ```

The server executes the appropriate function based on the command received from the client. If a filename is provided in the command, it is passed as an argument to the function.

## Output Handling

After executing the requested function, the server captures the output generated by the function and sends it back to the client. The output is stored in a temporary file, and its path is sent as a response to the client.
